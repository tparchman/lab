# BIOL 792 - Fall 2022
This repo contains practice code and other random notes related to Tom's BIOL 792 Python course.  At a minimum, this will hold "assignment" scripts per the course schedule ([course GitHub here](https://github.com/tparchman/F22_BIOL792_coursepage")).

I might add notes or other scripting practice stuff as it seems appropriate.
