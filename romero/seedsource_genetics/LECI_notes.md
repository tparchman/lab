# LECI *Leymus cinereus* (Basin wildrye) mixes - see Sarah Kulpa comms
## Mixes
4 mixes created - growout planting 2015ish?  
'zone' names relative to SZs in GB only (not nationwide) - bigger numbers *generally* imply hotter and drier
    
PSZ1 (°F) = winter minimum temp (at 5° intervals)  
PSZ2 (°C/m) = mean annual temp + 15° / mean annual precip (i.e. heat/evaporative pressure relative to avail. water)
    
TZ tests performed on roughly half of all population source
* **Zone 8**
    + PSV 10-15 °F / 6-12 Nevada
    + Ploidy source **MIXED**
        + 4 tetra, 5 octo
    + restoration planted - **yes**
    + per acre yield **70.1**
* **Zone 11**
    + PSV 15-20 °F / 3-6 Nevada & Utah
    + Ploidy source **TETRA?**
        + 4 tetra, 1 untested?
    + restoration planted - **yes**
    + per acre yield **190.7**
* **Zone 12**
    + PSV 15-20 °F / 6-12 Nevada
    + Ploidy source **MIXED**
        + 2 tetra, 5 octo, 1 untested?
    + restoration planted - **no**
    + per acre yield **41.6**
    + Beth may have bags on hand
* **Zone 16**
    + PSV 20-25 °F / 6-12 Nevada
    + Ploidy source **MIXED**
        + 4 tetra, 1 octo
    + restoration planted - **no**
    + per acre yield **54.4**
    + Beth may have bags on hand
    + Based on weight of input seeds, seems likely this is *mostly tetraploid*? - single population makes up more than half of total source
    
## Ploidy
Mixed-ploidy mixes had much lower growout yield relative to the 1 tetraploid mix (Zone 11)
Tetraploid and octoploid races considered *relatively* allopatricin wild (see Jones et al. 2009)
* Octoploids found mostly west of continental divide in WA & BC
* Tetraploids found more in ID, UT, CO, WY, MT, AB & SK
* ploidy overlap in NV, OR, and northeast CA  
  
Octoploid-tetraploid crossing produces high level of sterile hexaploids (did I read this somewhere specifically?)
## Design Ideas
### Using existant mixes Zone 12 & 16
**Identify ploidy levels of mix**
* Greenhouse growout (individual seeds? N=1000)
    + Subsample from individuals that germinate and test ploidy
    + **ISSUE**: would there be ploidy bias in greenhouse germination rates?  

**Plant mixes in different restoration environments**
* 2x3 design (2 mixes, 3 sites)
    + If we can source other seeds, develop specific mixes of ploidy (e.g. 1 tetraploid dominant, 1 octoploid dominant?)
## Strategies
* Identify any restoration plantings with these mixes
    + Seems like Zone 8 and Zone 11 were planted somewhere...when?
    + Worth trying to sample survival (probably not getting germination)?  
    + Is data meaningful if we cannot characterize genetic makeup of seed source itself? (i.e. we can only characterize final survived pop. relative to initially collected pops.)
* Acquire any remaining mix and test for population sources
    + Would give info on how input populations (and relative abundance)
* Grow any mix - see below, but either in controlled environment or in restoration setting?
* Already have data on natural/input populations or need to field sample?
* Supplement any absent ploidy or TZ test data?
## Other Thoughts & Quesitons  
Some suggestion that emperical zones for LECI exist. True?
    
Where does genetic deviation occur?  
* Growout stage
    + Outcrossing between multi-sourced populations
    + Single source actually includes multiple populations (how constrained are initial collections and definitions of a 'source population'?)
    + Selection of seed for subsequent growouts or for use in restoration mixes (e.g. bias of large seed mass)
* Restoration stage
    + Variable survival of different populations in seed mix (emergent population doesn't reflect makeup of seed mix **or** populations selected for growout)
  
Would we need to grow out any seed mix in controlled environment to determine genetic makeup of mix or can we gather this from seeds alone (i.e. do we care about mix-makeup post-growout & pre-restoration independent of germination or do we only care about natural germination?)
    
Consider both effects of ploidy and population differences (also consider relative to PSZs?)


Can we buy seeds granite? SNS? BFI? Comstock? 3 collections? what do you have, where do they come from, what is the ploidy? KRLA ELEL CHDO ACTE
