# General organization for repository

This is a place to keep code, literature, and project workflows organized for sharing etc. Different directories for different projects, directory trees within each for different types of analyses, perhaps.


## Rough ideas for potential projects


### KRLA landscape genomics

This could be an ideal species to develop a number of projects around, involving phenotypic, ecological, restoration, and genomic angles. It grows beautifully in field and greenhouse environments, has restoration signficance, is diploid and does not have gigantic genome size.

Sampling has been started, currently have DNAs for ~300 individuals from 25 populations. We could generate preliminary data to work with while we expand collecting.

### 'forensic' restoration genetics (ACTH, or maybe even KRLA)

Focusing on species with pronounced spatial genetic structure (e.g., ACTH), make seed mixes, grow, and genotype to track which populations survive/thrive or not. Very substantial knowledge gap in restoration ecology and genetics is how worthwhile are seed mixes. Rob Massatti at USGS would be interested in talking more about this, and maybe helping us to scale up.


### restoration practices and seed genetics

Seed for restoration plantings has generally been collected and increased with methods that span a continuum for their potential to alter genetic variation away from natural conditions. This involves mass production of single cultivars, increase of seed pools representing population mixtures, to increase of seed pools from local population sources. 

### Genetic diversity doesnt predict restoration performance for a suite of seven great basin shrub, forb, and grass species

We have data and preliminary analyses done. This could be a starter paper; easy to write, could keep it simple, probably pretty easy to publish.
