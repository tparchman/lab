# KRLA - Notes related to field collections
## Add something here about expected range related to GBIF collections...  
Add map of collections
## *Thoughts on GBIF records*
* Recent records (particularly ~2015 onward...) seem to be highly reliable  both for probability that plants are still there and that coordinates represent exact location
* Records pre-2000 seem pretty shoddy, but can support the idea of persistent populations if combined with more recent records...
    + *Caveat* - areas of low population density or poor access may *only* have old records (e.g. central and eastern Nevada - these were frequently late 20th century perserved specimen samples but were still consistently present)
  
**Consider chances of land conversion!**  
Low disturbance or conversion history = higher reliability of old records  
So. CA -> bit of a mess, lots of private/public checkboarding, recent land acquisition and development, road changes, and so on...  
Cen. NV -> not much development, large swaths  

## *Observations from field (loosely organized)* 
...pictures would help...
### Plant Size

### Leaf morphology

### Leaf/Flower conditions

### Population sizes & continuity

### Communities?
## *Thoughts about future collections*
