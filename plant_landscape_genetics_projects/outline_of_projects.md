## Plant landscape genetics projects by species, with information on status and personnel. 

&nbsp;


### List will soon be updated by priority

&nbsp;

## *Artemisia tridentata*
- Trevor Faske leading (major dissertation chapter)
- data in hand
- GATK and entropy on deck
- Target journal: many options

## *Ericameria nauseosa* rangewide
- Trevor leading (major dissertation chapter)
- data in hand
- analyses mostly done
- target journal Evolution Letters

## *Chaenactic douglassii*
- Caro leading, with Trevor heavy help (joint first author if necessary)
- data in hand, promising
- GATK and entropy on deck, get into this once methods get dialed with *A. tridentata*
- Target journal: there will be many options, New Phytologist comes to mind as ideal if environment predicts ploidy

## *Achnatherium thurberiana*
- Caro most likely leading
- Clear spatial genetic structure
- Diverse phenotypic data available.
- Need to meet with Beth to talk about integrating spatial genetic structure and phenotypic data


## *Phacelia hastata*
- Data in hand, Caro leading with Bryce.


## *Poa secunda*
- Data in hand, awaiting first pass on analyses
- Caro maybe? Once we see what the data looks like, we can consider how to proceed.
