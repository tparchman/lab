## Plant landscape genetics projects by species, with information on status and personnel. 

&nbsp;


### List will soon be updated by priority

&nbsp;

## *Artemisia tridentata*
- Trevor Faske leading (major dissertation chapter)
- data in hand
- GATK and entropy on deck
- Target journal: many options
- phenotypic data coming

## *Ericameria nauseosa* rangewide
- Trevor leading (major dissertation chapter)
- data in hand
- analyses mostly done
- target journal Evolution Letters

## *Chaenactis douglassii*
- Caro leading, with Trevor heavy help (joint first author if necessary)
- data in hand, promising
- GATK and entropy on deck, get into this once methods get dialed with *A. tridentata*
- cleaned, demultiplexed fastqs:/archive/parchman_lab/tfaske/dusty_backup/demult/fastq
### Determining or inferring ploidy for the populations for which we lack flow cytometry
Need to collect additional ploidy information from Bryce.

More importantly use GBS2ploidy (Gompert et al. 201X, MER) to infer ploidy for populations with unknown.

### run polyploid entropy model.

- phenotypic data coming
- Target journal: there will be many options, New Phytologist comes to mind as ideal if environment predicts ploidy

## *Achnatherium thurberiana*
- Caro most likely leading
- Clear spatial genetic structure
- Diverse phenotypic data available.
- Need to meet with Beth to talk about integrating spatial genetic structure and phenotypic data
- UMAP is beautiful for this one.
- phenotypic data available


## *Phacelia hastata*
- Data in hand, Caro leading with Bryce.


## *Poa secunda*
- Data in hand, awaiting first pass on analyses
- Caro maybe? Once we see what the data looks like, we can consider how to proceed.
