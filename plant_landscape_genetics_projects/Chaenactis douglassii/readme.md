## Population genetic analyses
Summary of analysis goals:
- general landscape genomic structure, how this relates to ploidy (entropy)
- phylogenetic analyses to jointly address the hypothesis that polyploid populations have evolved independently multiple times
- Does environmental variation predict the occurrence of polyploidy
-
