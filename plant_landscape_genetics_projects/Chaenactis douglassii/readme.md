## Population genetic analyses
Summary of analysis goals:
- general landscape genomic structure, how this relates to ploidy (entropy)
- phylogenetic analyses to jointly address the hypothesis that polyploid populations have evolved independently multiple times:
  IQ-TREE2 to infer the tree 
  Ancestral states reconstruction (ape/phytools)
  Phylogenetic Network to infer past gene flow among populations and to correlate it to the independent evolution of polyploidy (PhyloNet)
- Does environmental variation predict the occurrence of polyploidy
-
